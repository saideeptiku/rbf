J. Machaj, P. Brida and R. Pich√©


#### Abstract:
A novel Received Signal Strength (RSS) rank based fingerprinting algorithm for indoor positioning is presented. Because RSS rank is invariant to bias and scaling, the algorithm provides the same accuracy for any receiver device, without the need for RSS calibration. Similarity measures to compare ranked vectors are introduced and their impact on positioning accuracy is investigated in experiments. Experimental results shown that proposed algorithm can achieve better accuracy than commonly used NN and WKNN fingerprinting algorithms.
